# PCR-primer
Find primers to pcr a gene

Copy and paste the gene information (bases around locus u want to get) from ncbi to the program
Then it will return some pairs of primers that are:
   Have appropriate GC% and Tm
   Tm between the pair is no more than 10 degree
   Not very likely to have complementarity between the two
   No self complementarity (hairpin)
   Length of primers are from 17 to 23 bp
   The length of product is from 200 to 500 bp
